ANSIBLE

important points :

1) Ansible control node can only be installed in Linux-based systems.
2) python 3 and winRM should be installed and configured on  ansible host nodes
3) Ansible can control windows, linux as well as mac machines.

How to install control node :

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> use the following commands to install ansible on Linux
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> open the ansible hosts file 
sudo nano /etc /ansible /hosts

note : path differs for different os. The above path is for ubuntu

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Add a group and group members in the hosts file

[group_name]
group_member_1 var1=var1Value var2=var2Value .....
group_member_2 var1=var1Value var2=var2Value .....
group_member_3 var1=var1Value var2=var2Value .....
.
.
.


note : group members can be added using ip address as well as hostname. (we have only experimented with ip address)
note : different variable values can be passed to every host by adding <varname>=<varvalue> after every member

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Add the required vars for each group as follows
[<group_name>:vars]
ansible_user=<client_user_name>
ansible_password=<client_password>
ansible_port=5986
ansible_connection=winrm  #(other alternative is SSH)
ansible_winrm_transport=basic
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> configure managed nodes (clients)
managed nodes should fulfill the following requirements
    1}winrm should be set up and running
    2}python should be installed

note: for windows machines, python is generally pre installed.
note: for our specific case we are executing the following steps :
  - create new user on client by the name "Crawler" and password "123"
  - change change hostname and ip address for ease of management
  - update timezone and disable cpu sleep
  - configure winrm
All of these steps are taken care of in the pre-deployment script.
Just run the pre_deployment_script.ps1 as administrator and give a new ip address and hostname when prompted
Once script is completed, restart the PC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> test ansible connection from control node to managed node using the following command
ansible <group_name or host_ip_address> -m win_ping

note: for linux: ping; for windows: win_ping
note: if you try to ping using ip address, it should first be added in the hosts file
note: if the ping doesn't get a pong response then it means the setup is not completed properly
